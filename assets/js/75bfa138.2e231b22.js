It provides seismic data it has as well an alarm output activated if a seismic intensity equivalent to 5 or higher on the JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) Seismic Intensity Scale occurs. This gives the option to shut down sensitive machines and equipment in case of devastative eartquake. The D7S sensor detects as well if the horizontal position of the sensor changes, which points towards a collapse of the structure where the sensor was deployed. It can only detect earthquakes (it cannot predict them, I think there is no device in the world yet that detects eartquakes!), measure the peak levels of the seismic intensity and send the peak values over LoRaWAN or LoRa P2P to a gateway.\n",(0,o.kt)("img",{alt:"TheKit",src:a(5053).Z,width:"2048",height:"1536"})),(0,o.kt)("h2",{id:"lora"},"LoRa"),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"If you are not familiar to ",(0,o.kt)("strong",{parentName:"p"},"LoRa"),', it is a short for simply "Long Range", and it is a wireless communication system popular for IoT. Nowadays we are seeing more and more LoRa enabled massive IoT deployments around from smart meter reading to waste management from tracking inventory to sensor measuring. LoRa\'s modulation scheme is based on chirp-based spread spectrum that can operate beneath the noise floor. The wireless standard sends data in small bursts with very little power.

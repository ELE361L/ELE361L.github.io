It has some improved features compared to its precedessor, KerberosSDR. This post is about using KrakenSDR with a well-known Single Board Computer (SBC), RaspberryPi. \\n\\n## Installation\\nIn this series, we will use KrakenSDR in fixed-point use case. Later we will post on its use in a vehicle. \\n- We connected data port of KrakenSDR to USB3.0 USB port on the RaspberryPi. \\n- We powered both RaspberryPi and KrakenSDR with 5V/10A power adapter. \\n- All 5 channels are connected to the whip antennas. \\n![KrakenSDR Connections](./KrakenSDRBaglantilar.jpg)\\n\\n## Antenna Array Setup\\nWe referred to [antenna array spacing Excel sheet](https://github.com/krakenrf/krakensdr_docs/raw/main/antenna_array/Antenna_Array_Size_Calculator.xlsx) by KrakenSDR in order to correctly place antennas. Later, we printed array spacer. Graphic shows TOP DOWN View and ANT 0 points to the forward direction of the array. \\n![Array Spacing Sheet](./AntenKoordinatlari.png)\\n![Antenna Placement](./AntennaArray.jpg)\\n\\n## Testing Web Application in Stationary Mode\\nAfter writing right image to the SD-card, allow a few minutes for the RaspberryPi to bootup. Since we will not be using Android app at this time, we will leverage offline hotspot created by RaspberryPi. Using hotspot, we will connect to a web application to control the system. We set the frequency to 433MHz because we will be testing with a simple remote key used to open garage doors. This is an ISM-band device transmitting on-off signals (OOK). Here is the keyfob we are using for the tests. \\n![Keyfob](./keyfob.jpeg)\\n\\n![Web Application](./KrakenSDRWebInterface.png)\\n\\nThere are many different DF methods, however KrakenSDR uses what is called Correlative Interferometry. In this method phase difference is used to determine the direction of the signal of interest. When we press the button on the remote key, the spectrum page shows the live spectrum display and waterfall. \\n![Spectrum View](./SpectrumAllChannels.png)\\n\\nAfter setting Polar graph type, we tested DF system at specific angles and obtained accurate results as shown in below screenshots. \\n\\n0 Degree          |  90 Degrees\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![](./0DereceTest.png) | ![](./90DereceTest.png)\\n\\n180 Degrees          |  270 Degrees\\n:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:\\n![](./180DereceTest.png) | ![](./270DereceTest.png)\\n\\nWe will be posting on DF with other tools and use cases. So, stay tuned for updates."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2023-10-07-welcome/welcome.md","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-07-welcome/welcome.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the ELE361L Communication Systems Laboratory Blog Page!","date":"2023-10-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 7, 2023","tags":[{"label":"hello","permalink":"/blog/tags/hello"}],"readingTime":0.175,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Murat Sever","title":"Lab coordinator","url":"https://github.com/murat-sever","imageURL":"https://github.com/murat-sever.png","key":"murat"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","title":"Welcome","authors":["murat"],"tags":["hello"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Direction Finding with KrakenSDR","permalink":"/blog/KrakenSDR1"}},"content":"Welcome to the ELE361L Communication Systems Laboratory Blog Page!\\n\\nThank you for your interest in ELE361L blog page.
